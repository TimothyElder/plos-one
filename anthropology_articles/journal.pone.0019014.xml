        <p>The inconsistency of predictions from solution concepts of conventional game theory with experimental observations is an enduring question. These solution concepts are based on the canonical rationality assumption that people are exclusively self-regarding utility maximizers. In this article, we think this assumption is problematic and, instead, assume that rational economic agents act as if they were maximizing their implicit utilities, which turns out to be a natural extension of the canonical rationality assumption. Implicit utility is defined by a player's character to reflect his personal weighting between cooperative, individualistic, and competitive social value orientations. The player who actually faces an implicit game chooses his strategy based on the common belief about the character distribution for a general player and the self-estimation of his own character, and he is not concerned about which strategies other players will choose and will never feel regret about his decision. It is shown by solving five paradigmatic games, the Dictator game, the Ultimatum game, the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the Public Goods game, and the Battle of the Sexes game, that the framework of implicit game and its corresponding solution concept, implicit equilibrium, based on this alternative assumption have potential for better explaining people's actual behaviors in social decision making situations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Solution concepts of conventional game theory are mainly based on the canonical rationality assumption that players are rational economic agents who act as if they were maximizing their self-regarding utilities. Nevertheless, increasing experimental data support that decision makers in human society often do not act in accordance with predictions from these kinds of solutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sally1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Gintis1">[4]</xref>. This suggests that new insights and mechanisms are required to reconcile this undeniable inconsistency between theory and experiments. Indeed, similar cases often arise as well in many other areas of study such as physics. Galileo, founder of modern mechanics, proposed that all free falling bodies would fall through a vacuum with the same uniform acceleration, and also realized that, to explain why, as legend has it, the larger one of the two iron balls he dropped from the Tower of Pisa hit the ground slightly ahead of the smaller one, the resistance from air through which the balls were falling must be taken into account <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Adler1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, the canonical rationality assumption provides a unified launching pad for a large body of theories in economics and related fields that work well to some extent and thus should not be given up lightly, but this does not imply that this assumption can be readily applied to explain people's actual behaviors without considering the effect of real game situations they are involved in, just as that of the air resistance on free falling balls.</p>
      <p>So far, many efforts have been devoted to the modification or extension of the canonical rationality assumption in game theory with the aid of experimental observations. For instance, bounded rationality and other-regarding preference of players are considered in behavioral game theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Gintis1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Camerer1">[6]</xref>. It is safe to say that people are not exclusively self-regarding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Camerer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Fehr1">[7]</xref>. Costly punishment across human societies even in one-shot game situations is a fine example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Henrich2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Herrmann1">[9]</xref>. People also show preferences for maximizing collective benefit or relative advantage over others' benefits in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-VanLange1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Rose1">[11]</xref>. However, almost all experiments are designed to be simple and clear to make sure that all subjects have understood the rules completely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Henrich1">[3]</xref>, so there is little sense in trying to explain these experimental data by bounded rationality. Likewise, evolutionary game theory cannot explain why there are subjects in experiments who prefer to choose the strategy that is not evolutionarily stable when they clearly know this information, such as cooperating in one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma games <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Nowak1">[12]</xref>. The solution concept based on psychological game theory invokes psychological analysis about the motivations of other players <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Colman1">[2]</xref>. In this article we will propose a promising solution concept which can not only avoid these vulnerabilities, but also provide better explanations of people's diverse behaviors unpredicted by conventional game theory based on the canonical rationality assumption.</p>
      <p>Although the experimental evidence that rational self-regarding utility maximizers exist in chimpanzee's societies might offer some support for the canonical rationality assumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Jensen1">[13]</xref>, many experimental results show that people are heterogeneous and behave differently when choosing rational strategies. The behaviors of decision makers in human society could be influenced by diverse factors such as sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Eckel1">[14]</xref>, age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Fehr2">[15]</xref>, emotions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sanfey1">[16]</xref>, past experience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Ahn1">[17]</xref>, educational background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Frank1">[18]</xref>, social distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Hoffman1">[19]</xref>, cultural difference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Henrich1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Roth1">[20]</xref>, and even experimental contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sally1">[1]</xref>. For example, economists are more likely than others to free ride in public goods experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Frank1">[18]</xref>, and there are the same players who converged to contribute nothing in a ten-period public goods experiment without punishment but contribute everything in a ten-period public goods experiment with punishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Fehr3">[21]</xref>. “Action is character”, wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald, author of The Great Gatsby, in one of his notebooks. What people do reflects what they are, and what people are implies what they do. We propose that rationality should be personal and related to the player's character. No matter how anomalous an action appears to be, it still should be thought as rational to those who take it after deliberation.</p>
      <p>In this article we try to formally incorporate into the solution concept of game theory the player's character, a parameter encapsulating all diverse factors that may influence his decision making. The characters of players reflect their personal weighting between cooperative, individualistic, and competitive social value orientations. We assume that all players have a common belief about the character distribution for a general player, and rational players act as if they were maximizing their character-related utilities (that is, implicit utility we shall define later on), which turns out to be a natural extension of the canonical rationality assumption. In this procedure, a game is transformed into a Bayesian game, the solution of which, Bayesian Nash equilibrium, is referred to as implicit equilibrium of the original game. An implicit equilibrium provides players with a concrete decision rule which varies with their characters, and no player would feel regret about his decision even though the outcome turns out not to be a Nash equilibrium. The idea behind our framework turns out to be similar to the ERC model, a theory of equity, reciprocity, and competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Bolton1">[22]</xref>. But the ERC model uses equity as one of the primitive hypotheses and fails to incorporate cooperative factors, although it does consider players' heterogeneity and the tension between individualistic and competitive orientations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Bolton1">[22]</xref>. In our framework, equity emerges in the Ultimatum game as a natural consequence of rational players acting as if they were maximizing their character-related utilities.</p>
      <p>Solution concepts based on the canonical rational assumption also assume that it is common knowledge that each player is rational, each player knows that all players are rational, each player knows that each player knows that all players are rational, and so on <italic>ad infinitum</italic>. It is probably safe to say that this is not realistic in most cases. The concept of bounded rationality in behavioral game theory is proposed to avoid this vulnerability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Camerer1">[6]</xref>. Instead, in our new framework of character and implicit equilibrium, we assume that the player facing a game situation chooses his strategy based on the common belief about the character distribution for a general player and the self-estimation of his own character, irrespective of what the characters of other players involved are, which strategies he think they will choose, and even whether they are rational or not. Rationality in our framework is only referred to as players maximizing their character-related utilities, and not as players with perfect memory and extraordinary computational capacity like supermen, and thus there is no need to invoke such concepts as bounded rationality. This contrast is one of the most important features of the concept of implicit equilibrium distinct from almost all other solution concepts proposed until now in game theory.</p>
      <p>The concepts of character and implicit equilibrium we propose here based on this new rationality assumption can better explain people's actual behaviors labeled as irrational by conventional game theory in the experiments of some paradigmatic games. For example, why are at least one third of the dictators willing to offer the recipients more than zero in the Dictator game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Murnighan1">[23]</xref>? Why is it a modal pattern that two players end up with around fifty-fifty allocation of the pie in the Ultimatum game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Henrich1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sanfey1">[16]</xref>? Why are there subjects who cooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sally1">[1]</xref> and contribute their endowments in the Public Goods game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Henrich1">[3]</xref>? And why do people feel well satisfied with their choices even though they do not choose their own preferred programs simultaneously in the Battle of the Sexes game? All these puzzling but attractive questions are going to be given more reasonable explanations in our new framework based on the character-related rationality assumption that is presented subsequently.</p>

      <title>Analysis</title>
      <p>We begin by defining an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-player noncooperative game in strategic form and, in passing, introducing the notations that will be used hereafter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Weibull1">[24]</xref>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the set of players, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of players. For each player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be a strategy of his and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the finite set of all his strategies. A vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is called a strategy profile. The set of strategy profiles is thus the Cartesian product <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function associated to player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the combined utility function of the game. Then a game in strategic form may be summarized as a triplet<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>We decompose a player's utility into two parts: the outward-looking utility and the inward-looking utility. The former reflects the benefit of the group as a whole gained from playing the game and is the same for all players concerned, whereas the latter reflects the relative advantage of the focal player gained over the utilities of the other players involved in the game. A player's character is defined to reflect his personal weighting between the outward-looking utility and the inward-looking utility, or equivalently, his personal weighting between intergroup and intragroup competition.</p>

      <p>A player's character may take any value in the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by definition.

In this case the allocation of utilities among players is irrelevant to him. One with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cares only about his self-regarding utility as in the canonical rationality assumption. This makes our new framework a natural extension of solution concepts in conventional game theory. One with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cares only about the inward-looking utility, that is, his advantage over other players. These three special cases reflect people's cooperative, individualistic, and competitive social value orientations, respectively, which form the theoretical basis for numerous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-VanLange1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Note that the inward-looking or outward-looking utility is distinct from the exclusively self-regarding or other-regarding utility. This is an issue about what factors should be considered as the primitive assumptions about people's instincts related to decision making. We think that the exclusively other-regarding preference as a primitive assumption might contradict the principle of individuals being the unit of natural selection. The definition of implicit utility in (4) is equivalent to<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e032" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>This implies that any player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, regardless of his character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, always gives a positive weighting to his exclusively self-regarding utility <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and thus he will never show an exclusively other-regarding preference by definition. Actually, the weighting player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> gives <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is always more than that he gives <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>The character of a player, which reflects his personality when facing a game situation, may vary with the contexts in which he needs to make a decision. For example, experimental data show that the cooperation rate usually decreases in repeated public goods games without punishment relative to in those games with punishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Fehr3">[21]</xref>, which reveals that players might update their characters by learning to adapt to particular situations. However, considering the fact that players from some specific social context usually follow the same code of conduct, whether religious, ethical, or legal, we assume that,</p>

      <p>In other words, for any focal player, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the best of his knowledge about other players in a one-shot game situation. As far as the real world is concerned, we think that it might be inappropriate to always assume that people who face a one-shot game situation have no knowledge of the characters of other players involved.</p>
      <p>By incorporating players' characters and their common belief about the character distribution for a general player, any game can be transformed into a Bayesian game. In particular, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

      <p>In contrast to the canonical rationality assumption, the idea underlying this transformation is referred to as the <italic>character-related rationality assumption</italic>; that is,</p>

        <p>According to the canonical rationality assumption, the rational dictator who acts as if maximizing his self-regarding utility would take advantage of his dominant position and thus choose to offer the recipient nothing. However, a consistent observation in experiments is that at least one third of the dictators are willing to offer the recipients more than zero across a wide variety of procedures and conditions, although it is true that most of the dictators offer nothing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Murnighan1">[23]</xref>.</p>

          <p>As a result of the recipient's inability to influence the allocation procedure, the implicit equilibrium presented in this proposition does not even need the dictator and the recipient to have a common belief <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> about the character distribution for a general player.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting that we can get <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by solving <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the proof above, which means that the dictator with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would still be better off if he offers the recipient <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> not more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> than not participating in the game, even though he does not manage to maximize his implicit utility due to some unknown reasons. In particular, those dictators with non-negative characters who fail to maximize their implicit utilities could be better off even though they offer the whole pie. This point may be helpful to the understanding and explanation of why there are the dictators who are willing to offer more than zero in experiments, except that those dictators with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> who care only about the collective benefit would anyway.</p>

          <p>Suppose that the proposer, player 1, offers a portion of the pie, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to the responder, player 2, and leaves <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to himself.

Solving these two inequalities, we get<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e099" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>So an offer <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that exits between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would be accepted by both players.</p>
          <p>Because the implicit utility <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of a proposer with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constantly equal to 1 whatever he gets from the allocation of the pie, his rational strategy is to offer any <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that will be accepted by the responder, that is, not less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, even as big as the whole pie.</p>
          <p>The implicit utility <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of a proposer with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreasing, so he would like to offer the lower bound of the offer that the responder will accept so as to maximize his implicit utility, that is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreasing and reaches the maximum 0.5 when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a rational proposer with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would never offer the responder more than half the pie.</p>
          <p>From the proof above we can also infer that the responder with non-negative character would accept any offer <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the proposer, since the lower bound <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Furthermore, since the upper bound <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the proposer with non-negative character might offer the responder any <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, even as big as the whole pie. In these two cases players would be better off than not participating in the game, even if they do not manage to maximize his implicit utility due to some unknown reasons. These two points might be helpful to explain why, in experiments, the offer <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distributes over the whole interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and there are the responders who accept the smallest nonzero offer and the proposers who offer the whole pie.</p>
          <p>As in the Dictator game, the implicit equilibrium presented in this proposition does not also require the proposer and the responder to have a common belief <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> about the character distribution for a general player, because of the asymmetrical positions of the two players in the allocation procedure. However, close inspection will reveal that this implicit equilibrium is inconsistent with our aforementioned presentation that, when a player who acts as if maximizing his implicit utility chooses a strategy, the characters of other players are irrelevant. The strategy we give here requires the proposer to estimate the character of the responder.</p>
          <p>Let us dig deeper into the procedure of the proof of this proposition. The upper bound of the offer that both players will accept, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, decreases with the character of the proposer <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreasing and reaches the minimum 0.5 when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while the lower bound, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, increases with the character of the responder <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreasing and reaches the maximum 0.5 when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If we think of student proposers as players who care only about their inward-looking utility and are good at estimating responders' characters, then this analysis can explain why offers above 0.5 are rare in student subjects in experiments. This analysis also gives us a far-reaching conclusion as follows.</p>

          <p><italic>In the Ultimatum game, half the pie is the unique offer that would be always accepted by any two players</italic>.</p>
          <p>Now the characters of both the proposer and the responder fade out completely. Actually, in the case where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, solving <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> gives us <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which can be satisfied by any two players by definition.

          <p>Fairness, or inequality aversion, is recognized as one of key elements in human strategic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sanfey1">[16]</xref>. Here we show that the proposer giving half the pie and the responder accepting it is an implicit equilibrium, irrespective of the characters of the proposer and the responder.

        <p>According to the canonical rationality assumption, one in this scenario would always defect since defecting is a dominant strategy. That is, one can always be better off by defecting than by cooperating, whether the other player defects or cooperates. By backward induction, we know, even in the finitely repeated version, defecting in all steps is the best choice. However, each could achieve a higher utility <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by both cooperating than 0 by both defecting. This is why the Prisoner's Dilemma game is often used as a synonym for “social dilemma”.</p>
        <p>The predictions given by the canonical rationality assumption contradicts experimental data. There are subjects who cooperate even in the last round of finitely repeated situations, and the experimental studies from 1958 to 1992 show that the cooperation rate of players ranges from 5% to 96.9%, with a mean of 47.4% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Sally1">[1]</xref>.

From this implicit equilibrium we can also infer that the players would tend to defect when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is near <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, because the portion of people with character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes far less whatever the character distribution for a general player is.</p>
          <p>Cooperation is considered as a third fundamental principle of evolution beside mutation and natural selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Nowak2">[29]</xref>. The repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game is used to describe cooperation between unrelated individuals. If the probability of another encounter between the same individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, cooperation can evolve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Nowak2">[29]</xref>. Now this proposition identifies <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as an important parameter in the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma game, either.

        <p>According to the canonical rationality assumption, a rational player in this scenario would free ride since free riding is a dominant strategy. One will incur a loss of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units of utility by contributing whatever others do. However, each of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> players could benefit most and get utility <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from all players contributing. This makes it a social dilemma essentially the same as the Prisoner's Dilemma game.</p>
        <p>In the Public Goods game experiments where players are permitted to contribute any fraction of their endowments, the mean contributions usually end up with between 40% and 60% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Henrich1">[3]</xref>. Although the definition of the Public Goods game in these experiments is not exactly the same as that given above, the data surely reflects that those subjects are not exclusively self-regarding utility maximizer. By the character-related rationality assumption that players act as if they were maximizing their implicit utilities, we may give a more reasonable solution to the Public Goods game defined here.</p>

        <p>According to the canonical rationality assumption, this game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: both watching soccer or both watching opera. In addition, this game has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium; that is, each player watches his preferred program with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the other player's preferred program with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When this game is played once without communication, multiple Nash equilibria can not give players much instruction, and disequilibrium may result. In contrast, the character-related rationality assumption that players act as if they were maximizing their implicit utilities can provide players with a more concrete strategy of play, given that they have a common belief <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> about the character distribution for a general player.</p>

          <p>We assume that the two players have a common belief <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> about the character distribution for a general player and player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e264" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would watch player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e265" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s preferred program when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e266" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>Further we assume that both players believe that the character of a general player is uniformly distributed over the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which leads to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Substituting it into the above inequality gives us<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e279" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(27)</label></disp-formula>Considering that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e280" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e281" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, one necessary condition for this inequality to be justifiable is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e282" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. So we can get<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e283" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(28)</label></disp-formula>Setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e284" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and solving it give us <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e285" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus it is an implicit equilibrium that one would watch the other player's preferred program if his character <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e286" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and otherwise he would watch his own preferred program.</p>
          <p>The procedure of proof shows that the implicit equilibrium in the Battle of the Sexes game is closely related to the players' common belief <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e287" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> about the character distribution for a general player. As an alternative, if we assume that both players believe that the character of a player is uniformly distributed over the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e288" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e289" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Then the same procedure as in the proof above leads to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e290" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Consequently, we arrive at the following conclusion.</p>

          <title>Proposition 7</title>
          <p><italic>In the Battle of the Sexes game, one would watch the other player's preferred program if his character </italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e291" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>, and otherwise his own preferred program, given that both players believe that the character of a general player is uniformly distributed over the interval </italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e292" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
          <p>Under both assumptions about the players' common belief <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e293" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> about the character distribution for a general player, the implicit equilibria are symmetric and works for either player. Further, we can expect that one will watch the other player's preferred program with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e294" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the first case, and with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e295" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the second case. Yet we have to emphasize that no player feels regret in implicit equilibrium even if they watch different programs, that is, they simultaneously choose to watch their own or the other player's preferred programs. This is totally distinct from Nash equilibrium where both players watching different programs is considered as disequilibrium in which they feel regret and want to change their strategies.</p>
          <p>When additional utility <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e296" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the company of the other player is extremely large (or extremely small), the implicit equilibria in both cases predict that the probability of one watching the other player's preferred program would approach <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e297" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or 0). These are consistent with the predictions of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium which says this probability is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e298" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Nevertheless, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e299" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e300" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e301" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the three Nash equilibria degenerate to one where each player would watch his own preferred program with certain, although these two players as a whole can still be better off by both watching soccer or both watching opera. In contrast, we can expect that one will watch the other player's preferred program with positive probability by the predictions of the implicit equilibria under both assumptions above. This point adds to the evidence that the implicit equilibrium might be more reasonable than the three Nash equilibria in the Battle of the Sexes game.</p>

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>The inconsistency of predictions from solution concepts of conventional game theory with experimental observations is an enduring question. By clearly taking the player's heterogeneity into consideration, we have shown in five paradigmatic games, the Dictator game, the Ultimatum game, the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the Public Goods game, and the Battle of the Sexes game, that the concepts of implicit game and implicit equilibrium have potential for better explaining people's actual behaviors in social decision making situations. This theoretical framework is based on the so-called character-related rationality assumption that rational economic agents act as if they were trying to maximize their implicit utilities. The cooperative, individualistic, and competitive social value orientations are incorporated as three special cases where the player's character equals 1, 0, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0019014.e302" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-VanLange1">[10]</xref>. The player chooses his strategy based on the common belief about the character distribution for a general player and the self-estimation of his own character, and he is not concerned about which strategies other players will choose and will never feel regret about his decision.</p>
      <p>The concept of character reflects players' heterogeneity, although it does not explicitly consider complicated psychological motivations as in psychological game theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Colman1">[2]</xref>. The ERC model does consider players' heterogeneity and the tension between individualistic and competitive orientations, but fails to incorporate cooperative factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Bolton1">[22]</xref>. The concept of implicit utility is basically a kind of utility transformation, but it is based on the player's self-estimation of his own character, rather than on some inflexible parameters that are supposed to be imposed on all players as in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-VanLange1">[10]</xref>. We suppose that the character-related rationality assumption as a natural extension of the canonical rationality assumption is the consequence of evolution, and surely we do not explicitly consider its evolutionary process as in evolutionary game theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Nowak1">[12]</xref> or bounded rationality as in behavioral game theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019014-Camerer1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, as aforementioned, a player's character could be influenced by so many factors that it seems to be a big question how to measure it. Even if this is the case, incorporating the player's character in analyzing games would no doubt be useful to explain people's diverse behaviors in decision making as we shown here. At this point it may be suitable to mention another fact from physics. The temperature of an object is also influenced by many complicated factors, yet now we can conveniently measure it using a thermometer. Likewise, constructing a proper procedure, or even a convenient device, to measure the character of a player facing a game situation is a promising and challenging project. Another interesting issue is how the character of a player (consequently his strategy) evolves in repeated game situations with new information about the strategies of other players in previous plays. The progress in either direction would further extend our understanding about the reason people cooperate in social dilemmas and the way decisions are actually made.</p>
