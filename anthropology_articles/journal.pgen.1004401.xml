<abstract>
<p>The genetic impact associated to the Neolithic spread in Europe has been widely debated over the last 20 years. Within this context, ancient DNA studies have provided a more reliable picture by directly analyzing the protagonist populations at different regions in Europe. However, the lack of available data from the original Near Eastern farmers has limited the achieved conclusions, preventing the formulation of continental models of Neolithic expansion. Here we address this issue by presenting mitochondrial DNA data of the original Near-Eastern Neolithic communities with the aim of providing the adequate background for the interpretation of Neolithic genetic data from European samples. Sixty-three skeletons from the Pre Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites of Tell Halula, Tell Ramad and Dja'de El Mughara dating between 8,700–6,600 cal. B.C. were analyzed, and 15 validated mitochondrial DNA profiles were recovered. In order to estimate the demographic contribution of the first farmers to both Central European and Western Mediterranean Neolithic cultures, haplotype and haplogroup diversities in the PPNB sample were compared using phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to available ancient DNA data from human remains belonging to the <italic>Linearbandkeramik-Alföldi Vonaldiszes Kerámia</italic> and Cardial/Epicardial cultures. We also searched for possible signatures of the original Neolithic expansion over the modern Near Eastern and South European genetic pools, and tried to infer possible routes of expansion by comparing the obtained results to a database of 60 modern populations from both regions. Comparisons performed among the 3 ancient datasets allowed us to identify K and N-derived mitochondrial DNA haplogroups as potential markers of the Neolithic expansion, whose genetic signature would have reached both the Iberian coasts and the Central European plain. Moreover, the observed genetic affinities between the PPNB samples and the modern populations of Cyprus and Crete seem to suggest that the Neolithic was first introduced into Europe through pioneer seafaring colonization.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Since the original human expansions out of Africa 200,000 years ago, different prehistoric and historic migration events have taken place in Europe. Considering that the movement of the people implies a consequent movement of their genes, it is possible to estimate the impact of these migrations through the genetic analysis of human populations. Agricultural and husbandry practices originated 10,000 years ago in a region of the Near East known as the Fertile Crescent. According to the archaeological record this phenomenon, known as “Neolithic”, rapidly expanded from these territories into Europe. However, whether this diffusion was accompanied or not by human migrations is greatly debated. In the present work, mitochondrial DNA –a type of maternally inherited DNA located in the cell cytoplasm- from the first Near Eastern Neolithic populations was recovered and compared to available data from other Neolithic populations in Europe and also to modern populations from South Eastern Europe and the Near East. The obtained results show that substantial human migrations were involved in the Neolithic spread and suggest that the first Neolithic farmers entered Europe following a maritime route through Cyprus and the Aegean Islands.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term “Neolithic” refers to the profound cultural and technical changes that accompanied the transition from a hunter-gatherer subsistence economy to an agro-pastoral producing system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Childe1">[1]</xref>. The first Neolithic societies originated 12 to 10 thousand years ago in a region of the Near East traditionally known as the “Fertile Crescent” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Ammerman1">[2]</xref>. From this region the Neolithic technology rapidly expanded to Anatolia reaching the rest of Europe in less than 3,000 years by following two main routes linked to different archaeological cultural complexes. The Danubian route, associated to the <italic>Linearbandkeramic</italic> (LBK) cultural complex, brought the Neolithic to the central European plains and from there to the British Islands and Scandinavia (Funnel Beaker Cultural Complex) while the Mediterranean one, associated to the <italic>Cardial-Impressa</italic> cultural complex, spread it along the Mediterranean coast up to the Atlantic façade of Iberia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Price1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>The nature of the diffusion of the Neolithic and the possible demographic input associated to it have been widely debated. In this regard, two extreme hypotheses representing opposite views have been formulated: the demic diffusion model (DDM) and the cultural diffusion model (CDM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Childe1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Ammerman1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Renfrew1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Piggott1">[5]</xref>. The former stands up for a “wave of advance” of Neolithic immigrants with subsequent genetic replacement of the hunter-gatherer (Mesolithic) populations while the latter proposes a cultural adoption of Neolithic practices from local populations, implying a genetic continuity since the Palaeolithic. Moreover, integrationist models that involve a different extent of interaction between immigrants and local hunter-gatherers while considering the effect of geographic barriers and agricultural boundary zones, have been also used to explain the transition to the Neolithic process at a more local scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Zvelebil1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Genetic analyses from modern and ancient populations have contributed extensively to this debate providing discordant results. Principal component analysis and spatial autocorrelation of allele frequencies of “classic” genetic markers in modern European populations showed a South East to North West cline compatible with a Neolithic DDM. The Neolithic contribution to the modern genetic pool was estimated in this case to be around 27% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Cavalli1">[7]</xref>. The frequency distribution of Y chromosome polymorphisms displayed a similar pattern and haplogroups F*, E3b, G and J2, representing a 22% of extant lineages, were initially identified as the main contributors of the Neolithic spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Semino1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Rosser1">[9]</xref>. However, the analysis of the geographic distribution of the microsatellite diversity of the allegedly Paleolithic haplogroup R1b1b2, has been recently reinterpreted as a signal of substantial demic diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Balaresque1">[10]</xref>. Phylogeographic analyses of another haploid marker, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), in Europe and the Near East initially supported a limited Neolithic genetic contribution of around 9–12% in the Mediterranean and 15–22% in Central Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Richards1">[11]</xref>. Molecular dating and founder analyses identified then mtDNA haplogroups J, T1 and U3 as the main genetic markers of this expansion, with probable contributions of some other lineages from clusters H and W <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Richards2">[12]</xref>. However, recent analysis of complete mtDNA sequences from the same region has pictured contradicting results depending on the analysis performed, from all mtDNA haplogroup expansions predating the Neolithic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Zheng1">[13]</xref> to Neolithic expansions of mtDNA haplogroup H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Fu1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the light of these results, the usefulness of modern genetic variability to reconstruct the Neolithic dynamics in Europe has been questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Deguilloux1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Rasteiro1">[16]</xref>. First of all, a certain level of genetic differentiation between hunter-gatherers and Near Eastern farmers has to be assumed in order to detect differences between both groups. Secondly, the existence of SE-NW clinal patterns in Europe may reflect the accumulation of small migrations entering the continent rather than a single migratory event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Zvelebil2">[17]</xref>. Finally, original population substructure and subsequent processes of genetic drift and founder effects can introduce errors into the estimation of coalescence dates of mitochondrial and Y chromosome haplogroups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Pierron1">[18]</xref>. In this regard, recent diachronic aDNA analyses of Central European populations have documented a fluctuation in haplogroup frequencies as a result of population bottlenecks and post-Neolithic migratory events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bollongino1">[20]</xref>. Besides, these estimated haplogroup dates do not necessarily correspond to the time of arrival of the lineages to the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Barbujani1">[21]</xref>. As a result, the misidentification of genetic variants associated to the Neolithic spread and the effect of post-Neolithic expansions in the genetic make-up of Europe could have introduced important biases in the estimations of the Neolithic component of the European gene pool producing misleading conclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Chikhi1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>During the last decade, ancient DNA analyses of Neolithic populations have provided a more reliable picture of the Neolithic transition process at a local scale. Studies have concentrated at the two edges of the two routes of the Neolithic wave of advance: Central/Northern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula/Southern France. In Central Europe and Scandinavia a DDM has been proposed to explain the observed genetic discontinuity between hunter-gatherers and the first farmer populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bramanti1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Skoglund1">[26]</xref>. However, recent analyses have suggested the coexistence of genetically distinct hunter-gatherer and farmer groups during several millennia at the same archaeological site, suggesting that the genetic replacement of hunter-gatherers populations was not complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bollongino1">[20]</xref>. In North Eastern Iberia and Southern France contradictory interpretations have been proposed to explain the nature of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition process. On one hand, mtDNA studies of Cardial Neolithic remains seem to favor a pioneer Near Eastern colonization of North Eastern Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Hervella1">[28]</xref>. On the other hand, mtDNA results of Epicardial, Middle and Late Neolithic populations have been interpreted as a signal of pre-Neolithic legacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Sampietro1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan2">[31]</xref>. Dating and cultural differences between the studied groups, the effect of genetic drift at the beginning of the Neolithic and differences in the methods of analysis used (model-based statistical inference <italic>vs</italic> assignment of mtDNA haplogroup dating categories respectively) could be responsible of the observed differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Richards2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>. Moreover, the Y chromosome diversity of the Epicardial and Late Neolithic datasets has also shown a predominantly Near Eastern influence, suggesting that males and females might have played a differential role in the Neolithic dissemination process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Rasteiro1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this framework, the knowledge of the original Neolithic genetic pool in the Near East seems essential to correctly identify the variants associated to the Neolithic spread and also to provide a more global picture of the Neolithic dynamics in Europe.</p>
<p>In order to examine the genetic background existing in the first Neolithic communities and its impact over the European genetic pool, we have studied 3 archaeological sites in Syria located in two geographic areas in which agricultural practices were first documented: the middle Euphrates valley and the oasis of Damascus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These sites are dated back to the Pre-pottery Neolithic B period (PPNB). It is during this initial Neolithic phase that animal husbandry first appears, while full-scale agricultural practices are documented in the whole Levant. At the PPNB there is also an increase in the size of the settlements, probably as a response to the population growth derived from the consolidation of the new food-producing economic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Guerrero1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>DNA preservation in ancient Near Eastern Neolithic samples</title>
<p>DNA preservation at the studied samples was assessed at three levels: (1) Estimating the number of copies of the target mtDNA in some of the extracts using a specific Real Time PCR design, (2) estimating the percentage of reproducible Hypervariable Segment I mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA-HVS1) sequences out of all the analyzed samples and (3) computing the miscoding lesions in clone sequences.</p>
<p>The average number of mtDNA HVS1 copies per amplified volume of extract was in all cases higher than 1000, with a mean value of 10.4×10<sup>4</sup> in Tell Halula and 1.1×10<sup>6</sup> in Tell Ramad, corresponding respectively to 7.44×10<sup>−5</sup> and 7.60×10<sup>−4</sup> ng/µl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s004">Table S1</xref>). Reproducible mtDNA sequences could be recovered from 24 out of 112 DNA extracts, corresponding to 15 different skeletons from Tell Halula and Tell Ramad (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s005">Table S2</xref>). Differences in sample recovery success ratios could be a result of the strict screening approach used –in which samples displaying more than 2 negative amplification results were discarded (30% of the aDNA extracts)- and of the differences in efficiency between the amplification strategy used in both laboratories. The overall ratio of endogenous DNA recovery for the studied remains was 23.8%.</p>
<p>The average number of miscoding lesions per clone and nucleotide in the studied samples was 0.0078 in Tell Halula and 0.0047 in Tell Ramad. Individual sample variability ranged from 0.0000 (sample H3) to 0.0303 (sample H68) in Tell Halula and from 0.0006 to 0.0101 in Tell Ramad, indicating a differential preservation across the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s006">Table S3</xref>). Damage values per sample are within the range reported by other authors in samples with similar chronology from temperate environments (La Braña: 0.0116–0.0163; Can Sadurní: 0.0054–0.0632; Chaves: 0.0092–0.0872; Sant Pau del Camp: 0.0000–0.0133).</p>

<p>In 10 cases it was possible to reconstruct the complete haplotype (nucleotide positions, np 16,126–16,369), while the extent of degradation of the remaining 5 samples only allowed the recovery of partial haplotypes. Nine different haplotypes were identified. Two of them were shared between 2 individuals of Tell Halula (16311C) and among 3 individuals of Tell Ramad (16224C 16311C 16366T). Motif 16293C, though, was present at both sites, pointing at a pre-existing common genetic pool in the region.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Shared haplotype analysis</title>
<p>The complete haplotypes were compared to a database of 9,821 mtDNA profiles from 59 modern populations from the Near East and South Eastern Europe and 2 Early Neolithic populations from Central Europe (LBK-AVK Neolithic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref>) and North Eastern Iberia (Cardial/Epicardial Neolithic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s007">Table S4</xref>).

<p>Two out of the 7 different complete PPNB haplotypes (16356C and 16293C, 28.57% of studied samples) were not represented in any of the modern and ancient populations of the database. From the remaining haplotypes only 16224C 16311C, the basal node of haplogroup K, was shared with the other two ancient populations, displaying a frequency of 9.52% in the Cardial/Epicardial dataset and of 23.08% in the LBK-AVK. This haplotype is distributed nowadays both in South Eastern Europe and the Near East with an average frequency of 4%. However, some populations such as Ashkenazi Jews, Csángó and Cyprus exhibit frequencies of this haplotype higher than 10% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s008">Table S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The remaining haplotypes had a very limited geographic distribution, being only documented in 1 individual from Bulgaria (16311C-K); 3 individuals from Turkey, Qatar and Yemen (16223T-L3); 4 Irani, Karakalpak, Turkish and Bedouin individuals (16256T-H) and 3 Druze from Israel (16224C 16311C 16366T-K).</p>

<title>Haplogroup composition</title>
<p>MtDNA haplogroups could be assigned to 14 out of the 15 skeletons according to the HVS1 sequences obtained and on the diagnostic Single Nucleotide Positions (SNPs) typed following Phylotree rCRS oriented version 15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004401-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s009">S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Haplogroup K was the most prevalent, (<italic>N</italic> = 6, 42.8%) followed by R0 (<italic>N</italic> = 3, 21.42%) and H (<italic>N</italic> = 2, 14.28%). The observed haplogroup frequencies were compared to those of 59 modern populations from the Near East and South Eastern Europe and 2 Early Neolithic populations from Central Europe (LBK-AVK Neolithic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref>) and North Eastern Iberia (Cardial/Epicardial Neolithic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>) (<italic>N</italic> = 11,610) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">Table S7</xref>).</p>
<p>Haplogroup K was present in almost all populations compared, and its mean frequency in South Eastern Europe and the Near East was around 7%. It reached its highest frequencies in certain populations that have experienced recent population bottlenecks, such as the Askhenazi Jews and the Csángó in Transylvania, Romania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Behar1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandsttter1">[34]</xref> and also among Greek Cypriots. Moreover, it was also highly represented in both Cardial/Epicardial (15.56%) and LBK-AVK (23.08%) Early Neolithic datasets. Haplogroup R0 is especially prevalent in the Near East and North Africa with a mean frequency in both regions around 6%. The maximum frequencies of R0 were detected in South Arabian populations such as Bedouin, Oman and Saudi Arabia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">Table S7</xref>). The rare European haplogroups U* and N* were also detected in 2 individuals in our ancient sample. The mean frequency of haplogroup U* is 2% in the Near East, 0.9% in the Caucasus region and around 1% in Europe, whereas the N* mean frequency is less than 1% in all three datasets. However, both haplogroups reach peaks of frequency in certain populations, such as haplogroup U* in Crete. The case of N* is especially interesting, because apart from Bulgaria, Crete, Romania and Serbia it was only represented in Near Eastern populations (Iran, Jordan, Near Eastern Jews, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkmenistan and United Arab Emirates). Moreover, this haplogroup was also detected in 4 Neolithic specimens from Catalonia, in North Eastern Spain, associated to the Cardial/Epicardial culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>. Carry- over contamination from these samples processed in the same laboratory can be ruled out, as results were validated in a second independent laboratory.</p>
<p>Finally, the skeleton H8 belonged to the African L3 lineage, this being the most prevalent African haplogroup found in present-day Near Eastern populations.</p>

<title>Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering</title>
<p>Principal Component Analysis with Hierarchical Clustering (PCA-HCA) was used to compare mean haplogroup frequencies of our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">Table S7</xref>) with the other populations of the database. Details about the method can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s011">Table S8</xref>.</p>
<p>The first six Principal Components (PCs), accounting for a 90.6% of the variance, were selected for Hierarchical Clustering Analysis. Six clusters (1–6) were defined based on the topology of the hierarchical tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The decomposition of the inertia computed on 6 axes supported this partition, indicating that with a division in 6 clusters up to an 80% of the data variation could be explained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s011">Table S8</xref>). The main haplogroups contributing to the cluster separation were Asian (AS: test value = 12.66; P = 0.000), African (AF: test value = 8.55; P = 0.000), H (test value = 8.96; P = 0.000) and K (test value = 8.01; P = 0.000).</p>
<p>The two biggest groups detected were Clusters 1 and 3, joining 43 of the 60 populations of the database. Cluster 1 mainly included European populations and it was distinguished by high frequencies of haplogroups H, U5, U4 and HV0 and by low frequencies of Asian and African types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004401-t002">Table 2</xref>). Near Eastern and some Caucasian datasets were grouped in Cluster 3. They were separated from European populations mainly by high frequencies of haplogroups J and T and low frequencies of H, HV0 and U5. Interestingly, LBK-AVK population was also included in this group. Its similarity with Caucasian populations like Georgia and Chechnya previously suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref> was also evident in our analysis.</p>

<p>Cluster 2 included our PPNB sample, grouped together with Ashkenazi Jews, Csángó, Cyprus and Cardial/Epicardial populations. High frequencies of haplogroups K and N* characterized this cluster (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004401-t002">Table 2</xref>), pinpointing the genetic affinities between the PPNB and the Cardial/Epicardial Neolithic dataset already stressed by the qualitative haplogroup and haplotype analyses.</p>
<p>Cluster 4 included populations from Africa or with a strong African component and it was defined by high frequencies of African haplogroups (L and U6) and low frequencies of haplogroup H. Western Asian populations were clearly separated from Near Eastern datasets in clusters 5 and 6. Both were distinguished by a high frequency of Asian haplogroups and a low frequency of European types. The inclusion of Romani population within cluster 5 is in agreement with its Asian origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gresham1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>The partition model proposed here supports the existence of geographic barriers for mitochondrial markers. Major geographic zones like Europe, the Near East and Eastern Asia are clearly distinguished. However, populations at boundary zones such as the Caucasus are clustered both with European and Near Eastern pools.</p>
<p>The PCA-HCA for the two first PC factors, accounting respectively for 48.32% and 19.78% total genetic variation, is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g003">Figure 3</xref>. On one hand, the first PC distinguished populations with and without Asian haplogroups, separating clusters 5 and 6 from 1, 2, 3 and 4. On the other hand, the second PC separated those populations with African (Cluster 4) and non-African (Clusters 1, 2 and 3) haplogroups. Cluster 3, containing Near Eastern and Caucasian populations, occupied an intermediate position in the plot. According to the two first PCs the PPNB population, included in Cluster 2, was equidistant to the centers of this cluster and Cluster 3 and close to modern populations from the Fertile Crescent, such as Jordan and Palestine. Affinities of the PPNB population with populations within Cluster 3 were due to high frequencies of haplogroup R0 in all of them. The Cardial/Epicardial Neolithic population, also member of Cluster 2, was in this case closer to Cluster 1 due to its moderate frequencies of haplogroups H and U5.</p>

<p>Cluster 2 was clearly distinguished from the other 5 clusters by PC4, which summed up a 6.64% of the global genetic variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s011">Table S8</xref>). The graphical plot of PC3 and PC4 separated populations by their frequencies of haplogroups HV, J and T (PC3) and K (PC4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This graph situated the PPNB sample at the edge of PC4 axis, close to Cardial/Epicardial and Ashkenazi Jew populations.</p>

<title>Genetic distances</title>
<p>Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> genetic distances were computed between the PPNB and the other populations of the database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s012">Table S9</xref>). Non-significant pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> values were obtained between PPNB and Cyprus (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.013; P = 0.2734), Ashkenazi Jews (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.028; P = 0.1087), Csángó (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.022; P = 0.1087) and Khoremian (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.0456; P = 0.0805). These populations also exhibited the lowest F<sub>ST</sub> values. The highest significant distances corresponded to Gilaki, Caucasian Jews and Mazandarian populations (F<sub>ST</sub>&gt;0.2).</p>
<p>When modern populations were grouped in geographic regions, the PPNB population was genetically closer to Near Eastern and Caucasian than to Southern European populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004401-t003">Table 3</xref>). The Cardial/Epicardial and LBK-AVK populations showed low F<sub>ST</sub> values with the modern Near Eastern pool, as previously stated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>. It is important to note, however, that the F<sub>ST</sub> index between LBK-AVK and the pooled Southern European populations was lower than the one reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Methodology and authenticity of the results</title>
<p>One of the inherent limitations of ancient DNA human studies is the possibility of contamination with exogenous DNA, a risk that is enhanced when human DNA is studied and a PCR approach is used. As a result a series of authentication criteria were proposed early at the beginning of the discipline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Cooper1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Pbo1">[37]</xref>. However, it has been recognized that on one hand, a complete level of authentication cannot be achieved in most of the cases and on the other, the strict application of all the criteria does not provide a 100% proof of the authenticity of the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gilbert1">[38]</xref>. The importance of the retrieved results as a potential comparative framework for other ancient DNA studies requires the reported data to be solid and unambiguous. As such, to guarantee the authenticity of our results we have used a combination of classical criteria of authenticity and a self-interpretative approach as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gilbert1">[38]</xref>. These criteria include the replication of the results within the same or in a second laboratory, Real-Time PCR estimation of the number of DNA copies in the extracts, bacterial cloning of amplicons and a self-critical analysis of the obtained results. Trace contaminant DNA was detected through a detailed analysis of clone sequences. Phylogenetic sense observed between HVS1 mtDNA fragments and haplogroup specific SNPs at the mtDNA coding region provided further support to the authenticity of the obtained results. Sequence artifacts like chimerical haplotypes arisen by amplification of fragments of multiple origin (<italic>i.e</italic> contaminant, endogenous and damaged) could be ruled out through replication, as they occur at random and are not reproducible in different amplifications and extractions from the same or different skeletal samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Pbo1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, DNA content in the amplified extracts provided in all cases a number of starting copies higher than 1,000, thus making the possibility of displaying hybrid haplotypes highly improbable. The possibility of contamination between samples displaying the same haplotype (<italic>i.e.</italic> H4, H7, H28, H25; H3, R64-4II, R69(2) and R65-14, R65-C8-SEB, R65-1S) could be also discarded as they were processed in different extraction and amplification batches and validated through independent replications, some of them conducted in two different laboratories.</p>
<p>Even though the success recovery ratio is low (23.8%), this study demonstrates that it is feasible to recover ancient DNA genetic information from temperate environments and suggests that other variables rather than the temperature operate in the DNA preservation through several millennia.</p>
<p>Ancient DNA preservation in Near Eastern open-air sites has been previously stated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bollongino2">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Salamon1">[42]</xref>. The reported success ratios are variable, ranging from 4% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Edwards1">[40]</xref> to 86% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Salamon1">[42]</xref>. In the case of Tell Halula, the skeletons were located at opened pits under the main floor of the house. The pits were sealed using a cover made of mud brick of about 20 cm that in some cases was also plastered at the top <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Kuijt1">[43]</xref>. This particular burial structure might have protected the human remains from DNA degradation. The absence of sample cleaning with water and the storage in freezers shortly after the excavation, should have also prevented skeletal remains from post-depositional degradation and contamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bollongino2">[39]</xref>. The recovery of insoluble collagen fractions (&gt;30,000 Da) in the same remains is also an indicator of their good biomolecular preservation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Fernndez1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Sosa1">[45]</xref>.</p>

<title>Modern mtDNA Near Eastern variability as a proxy of Near Eastern Neolithic variability</title>
<p>In recent years, the body of ancient DNA data of Neolithic populations has increased dramatically, providing a more accurate picture of local Neolithic dynamics. Some of these studies have also explored the Mesolithic genetic background, interpreting the results in terms of continuity or genetic break with the predecessor hunter-gatherer communities of the area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bollongino1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bramanti1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Malmstrm1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Hervella1">[28]</xref>. However, most of the attempts to estimate the Neolithic genetic input in those populations and/or to reconstruct the routes of dispersion of the first farmers into Europe have relied on extant data from modern Near Eastern populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Sampietro1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan2">[31]</xref>. In the present research, ancient DNA results from the original human Near Eastern Neolithic communities are presented, to our knowledge, for the first time.</p>
<p>The present study shows that even though the mitochondrial variability of the PPNB population is within the limits of modern Near Eastern, Caucasian and South Eastern European populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004401-t003">Table 3</xref>), both haplotype and haplogroup PPNB frequencies clearly deviate from their modern successors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s008">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">S7</xref>). This indicates that the mitochondrial DNA make-up of modern Near Eastern populations may not reflect accurately the genetic picture of the area at the emergence of the Neolithic.</p>
<p>All the detected haplotypes but one -the basal node of haplogroup K- have a null or limited distribution in the modern genetic pool, suggesting that a great bulk of ancient Neolithic lineages were not integrated into their succeeding populations or were erased by subsequent population movements in the region. This is in agreement with previous observations from other Early Neolithic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak2">[46]</xref>, and underlines the importance of genetic drift processes at the beginning of the Neolithic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Rasteiro1">[16]</xref>. Nevertheless, the multi-population comparative analyses performed here also suggest that certain population isolates of Middle Eastern origin, like the Druze, could have retained an ancient Neolithic genetic legacy through cultural isolation and endogamous practices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Shlush1">[47]</xref>. Another interesting case are the Ashkenazi Jews, who display a frequency of haplogroup K similar to the PPNB sample together with low non-significant pairwise Fst values, which taken together suggests an ancient Near Eastern origin. This observation clearly contradicts the results of a recent study, where a detailed phylogeographical analysis of mtDNA lineages has suggested a predominantly European origin for the Ashkenazi communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Costa1">[48]</xref>. According to that work the majority of the Ashkenazi mtDNA lineages can be assigned to three major founders within haplogroup K (31% of their total lineages): K1a1b1a, K1a9 and K2a2. The absence of characteristic mutations within the control region in the PPNB K-haplotypes allow discarding them as members of either sub-clades K1a1b1a or K2a2, both representing a 79% of total Ashkenazi K lineages. However, without a high-resolution typing of the mtDNA coding region it cannot be excluded that the PPNB K lineages belong to the third sub-cluster K1a9 (20% of Askhenazi K lineages). Moreover, in the light of the evidence presented here of a loss of lineages in the Near East since Neolithic times, the absence of Ashkenazi mtDNA founder clades in the Near East should not be taken as a definitive argument for its absence in the past. The genotyping of the complete mtDNA in ancient Near Eastern populations would be required to fully answer this question and it will undoubtedly add resolution to the patterns detected in modern populations in this and other studies.</p>
<p>Our PPNB population includes a high percentage (80%) of lineages with a Palaeolithic coalescence age (K, R0 and U*) and differs from the current populations from the same area, which exhibit a high frequency of mitochondrial haplogroups J, T1 and U3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">Table S7</xref>). The latter have been traditionally linked with the Neolithic expansion due to their younger coalescence age, diversity and geographic distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Richards1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Richards2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Soares1">[49]</xref>. In addition to the PPNB population, haplogroup T1 is also absent in other Early Neolithic populations analyzed so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Zvelebil2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Chikhi1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Skoglund1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan1">[30]</xref>. Haplogroup U3 has been found only in one LBK individual and it has been suggested that it could have been already part of the pre-Neolithic Central European mitochondrial background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Haplogroup J is present in moderate frequencies in Central European LBK-AVK populations (11.75%) and it has been proposed as part of the Central European “mitochondrial Neolithic package” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>. However, it has also been described in one late hunter-gatherer specimen of Germany, raising the possibility of a pre-Neolithic origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bramanti1">[23]</xref>. Haplogroup J is present in low frequency (4%) in Cardial/Epicardial Neolithic samples of North Eastern Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Hervella1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan2">[31]</xref>. Absence of Mesolithic samples from the same region prevents making any inference about its emergence during the Mesolithic or the Neolithic. However, its absence in the PPNB genetic background reinforces the first hypothesis.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that (1) late Neolithic or post-Neolithic demographic processes rather than the original Neolithic expansion might have been responsible for the current distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups J, T1 and U3 in Europe and the Near East and (2) lineages with Late Paleolithic coalescent times might have played an important role in the Neolithic expansive process. The first suggestion alerts against the use of modern Near Eastern populations as representative of the genetic stock of the first Neolithic farmers while the second will be explored in depth in the following section.</p>

<title>Near Eastern Neolithic genetic contribution to the European gene pool</title>
<p>The sharing of mitochondrial haplotypes and haplogroups between pre-pottery farmers from the Fertile Crescent and European Neolithic populations, suggests a genetic contribution of the first Neolithic communities in the European mitochondrial genetic pool.</p>
<p>Haplogroup composition and PCA-HCA of the three ancient datasets compared here allow us to identify K and N*-derived haplogroups as potential Neolithic genetic contributors. Haplogroup K is present in all Early Neolithic datasets published so far with frequencies ranging from 7.7 to 43% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">Table S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Hervella1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Lacan2">[31]</xref>). Moreover, it is absent in Central European and Northern Iberian Paleolithic/Mesolithic mitochondrial backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bollongino1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bramanti1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Hervella1">[28]</xref>. The presence of “rare” paragroup N* in both Cardial and Epicardial samples from North Eastern Iberia and PPNB populations confirms the connection between both edges of the Neolithic expansion previously suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Haplogroup N1a, representing 12.75% of LBK-AVK samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brandt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Haak1">[24]</xref>, is not present in our PPNB sample, making it unlikely that this cluster was introduced from the earliest PPNB farmers of this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Bramanti1">[23]</xref>. A more complex pattern for the LBK-AVK Neolithic expansion route, involving migration and admixture episodes with local hunter-gatherers in frontier zones (for example the predecessor populations of <italic>Starčevo-Criş-Körös</italic> cultures) should be considered in order to explain the available data for Neolithic populations of Central and Northern Europe. To solve this uncertainty, ancient DNA analysis from the Balkans region seems of vital importance.</p>
<p>The signal of both rare N-derived haplogroups over the Neolithic genetic pool must have been erased by subsequent genetic drift events after the consolidation of Neolithic practices, as it has been suggested in other works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Deguilloux1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Gamba1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Brotherton1">[50]</xref>.</p>

<title>Routes of Neolithic expansion from the Near East into Europe</title>
<p>In the absence of ancient genetic data from populations in the primary and secondary Neolithization areas, a detailed comparison of the genetic composition of the PPNB population with modern adjacent populations can shed light on possible routes of Neolithic expansion.</p>
<p>As for modern Near Eastern populations, the frequency distribution of PPNB mitotypes in modern South Western European populations is limited (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s008">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">S7</xref>). However, strong genetic affinities at different levels of comparison could be detected with the islands of Cyprus and Crete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s005">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s008">Tables S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s010">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s012">S9</xref>), pointing out at a survival of ancient Neolithic genetic stock in these populations probably through endogamy and geographic isolation.</p>
<p>The absence of an equivalent detectable genetic pattern in modern South-Western Anatolia suggests a primary role of pioneer seafaring colonization through Cyprus and the Aegean islands along the southern coast of Anatolia to the western coast of Greece.</p>
<p>This observation is supported by three facts:</p>
<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item>
<p>The archaeological parallels found between the pre-pottery Neolithic of the Levant and those of Cyprus and the Aegean islands in terms of radiocarbon dating, settlement architecture, material culture, cereal and domestic animal species provide evidence for a sea-mediated arrival of Levantine people to Cyprus soon after the development of the agriculture, during the late PPNA or early PPNB, and a further expansion towards the Aegean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Peltenburg1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Perls1">[54]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The finding of PPNB lineages (U*) together with a high frequency of haplogroup K (16%) in a recent survey of Minoan mtDNA indicates a pre-Bronze arrival of these genetic traits of the island. Moreover, this result is in agreement with the archaeological information pointing at a Near Eastern Neolithic origin of the Bronze Age Cretan culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Hughey1">[55]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Spatial interpolation of radiocarbon dates has identified the Middle Euphrates-South Turkey region as the original centre of Neolithic expansion, and the maritime route through Cyprus, Crete and the Aegean islands as the primary route of Neolithic expansion from the Near East <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-BocquetAppel1">[56]</xref>.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>An alternative scenario of land-mediated expansion through Western Anatolia would assume a survival of the genetic traits observed in the PPNB sample until the end of the period, when Middle-PPNB descendant populations would have expanded to secondary, adjacent areas of Neolithization around 7,500–7,000 years B.C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Cauvin1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-GoringMorris1">[58]</xref>. This framework is not supported by the obtained data, but cannot be completely discarded as genetic drift or post-Neolithic genetic remodeling of the area might have erased ancient genetic signatures, as already stated from modern Near Eastern populations. Considering that the Neolithic expansion process was not uniform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Guilaine1">[59]</xref>, the development of appropriate, spatially-explicit, model-based, statistical inference tools could be of great assistance in fully exploring the probabilities of these and other, competing demographic scenarios.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study of ancient DNA from the original geographic areas of Neolithic expansion performed here suggests a demic contribution of the first Near Eastern Neolithic in both main European routes of Neolithic expansion. Moreover, the population comparative analysis performed here points out at a leading role of seafaring colonization events in the first Neolithic expansions reaching the European continent. Further ancient DNA data from other primary and secondary areas of Neolithization and new data from frontier zones will be needed to add more resolution over the routes of expansion and the extent and nature of the genetic impact of the Neolithic over the European genetic pool.</p>

<p>The studied material consisted of 63 ancient human skeletons from 3 different archaeological sites dating back to the PPNB time period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s013">Table S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004401-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Tell Halula is located in the Middle Euphrates basin, 150 Km East of the city of Aleppo in the present territory of Syria. Excavations in the site, 8 hectares in area, have been in progress for the last 18 years by a Spanish Archaeological Mission in Syria. The excavations performed over an area of 2,500 m<sup>2</sup> documented more than 40 occupation levels with thousands of stratigraphic units. A continuous occupation of the site can be assumed between 7,900–5,700 cal. B.C., spanning from the PPNB to the Neolithic-Chalcolithic transition (Halaf and Obeid periods) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Molist1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Faura1">[63]</xref>. PPNB occupation phases (I-XX) are located at the southern part of the Tell (sectors 2/4). Each phase is defined by successive human occupations followed by destruction/construction of habitation units. The houses were built one beside the other, oriented southward, and the deceased were buried by digging the graves in the floor of the house and covering them with a slide that allowed a clear association between the graves and the occupation floors. Most of the graves were located at the main entrance of each house, under a porch area. A total of 21 houses from PPNB levels have been unearthed to date, although only 14 of them have documented burial structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Guerrero2">[64]</xref>. The skeletons analyzed in this paper belonged to occupational phases VIII-XIII on PPNB levels (7,500–7,300 cal. B.C.).</p>
<p>The Tell Ramad archaeological site is located 20 Km south of Damascus on the slopes of Mount Hermon, in a basaltic plateau 830 m in height at the end of the river Wadi Sherkass, which flows in the Damascus basin. Human occupation was documented from early PPNB to ceramic Neolithic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Ferembach1">[65]</xref>. Radiocarbon dating of the site provided dates from 8,300 to 7,750 years B.P. for the PPNB levels (7,300–6,650 cal. B.C.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Asouti1">[66]</xref>. The burial model found at Tell Ramad is very similar to that in Tell Halula. The inhumations consisted of narrow tombs in the floor of the house, but evidence of common graves has also been documented.</p>
<p>Dja'de El Mughara is located on the left bank of the Middle Euphrates, also in Syria. The excavations revealed three historical horizons corresponding to Early PPNB (9,400–8,700 B.P., 8,700–8,250 cal. B.C.), Pre-Halaf ceramic Neolithic (7,700–7,400 B.P.) and Early Bronze Age (5,000 B.P.). The burial patterns found at the PPNB levels are very similar to those documented at Tell Halula and Tell Ramad with the graves located under the floor of the houses, but big collective funerary practices were also documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Coqueugniot1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Desmeulles1">[68]</xref>. Most samples from this site were collected by an experienced researcher in ancient DNA analysis (AP-P). The same person selected additional samples during the anthropological analyses.</p>
<p>All the collected samples were neither washed nor treated after excavation. After collection, the samples were sent directly to the laboratory, where they were immediately studied. Contamination prevention measures were taken during all the selection processes, including the use of gloves and face shields. All the researchers involved in the handling of the samples during and after the excavation were typed for mtDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s014">Table S11</xref>).</p>

<p>Approximately 600 mg of the obtained powder was washed a minimum of 3 times with 8 ml 0.5 M EDTA pH 8, and then incubated over-night at 37°C in 10 ml of lysis buffer solution (5 mM EDTA, 10 mM TRIS, 0.5% SDS, 50 µg/ml proteinase K) in a hybridization oven. Tissue remains were removed by centrifugation and DNA was extracted from the supernatant with Phenol/Chloroform. The aqueous phase was concentrated by centrifugation dialysis using Centriplus 30,000 micro-concentrators (Millipore) and desalted with 15 ml sterile water (Braun) to a final volume of 300 µl.

<title>Precautions and authentication criteria</title>
<p>The following precautions and authenticity standards were observed for validating the obtained results: (1) Samples were collected on the field by staff trained in ancient DNA analysis. (2) Collected samples were unwashed to prevent pre-laboratory contamination. (3) All the analyses were performed in exclusive ancient DNA laboratories in which extraction, preparation of <italic>PCR</italic> reactions and <italic>post-PCR</italic> procedures were physically separated. (4) Access to extraction and <italic>PCR</italic> laboratories was restricted to two researchers (EF and CG), who wore clean-room protective clothes, gloves and facemasks. (5) The laboratories were routinely cleaned with bleach and UV-irradiated. (6) The samples and reagents were manipulated in laminar flow hoods, which were previously cleaned with bleach and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 30 minutes. (7) Exclusive material for ancient DNA analysis was employed in every experimental process. (8) Before the analysis, plastic material and pipettes were placed in the cabinet and UV-irradiated for 30 minutes. (9) All individuals were independently extracted at least twice in two independent laboratories except in two cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s005">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s006">S3</xref>). (10) Each studied mtDNA fragment was amplified in separate laboratories at least twice. (11) Only extracts and amplicons from extraction and amplification groups providing negative results at the blanks were considered. (12) Reproducible direct sequences were cloned, and between 10 and 15 clones per amplicon were sequenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s006">Table S3</xref>). (13) The DNA amount in the DNA extracts was estimated by Real Time <italic>PCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s004">Table S1</xref>), providing in all cases a number of copies higher than 1,000. This result is high enough to guarantee sequence reproducibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004401-Handt1">[74]</xref>. (14) Obtained mtDNA sequences were compared to those from all the archaeologists (MM), anthropologists (AP-P, JA, IO) and researchers (EF, CG, MT, EP) involved in the retrieval or manipulation of the studied samples in order to detect pre-laboratory and laboratory contaminations. For additional security, staff working at the two laboratories involved in the analysis during this period was also typed (DT, JG, EA, AL, CB, JA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004401.s014">Table S11</xref>).
